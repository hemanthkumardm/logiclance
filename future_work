# üìú **LogicLance: Future Work Document for `setup_gui` Enhancements**

## üìã **Overview**

### Purpose
This document outlines the future enhancements planned for the `setup_gui` component of LogicLance, aiming to elevate it to an industry-grade level suitable for top ASIC design companies (e.g., Intel, NVIDIA, TSMC). The current version of `setup_gui` provides basic project setup functionality (e.g., creating directories, configuring project settings, managing users), but lacks the scalability, security, integration, and automation required for large-scale, enterprise environments. This roadmap defines the next steps to address these gaps, ensuring LogicLance can support complex ASIC design workflows in its next version.

### Current State of `setup_gui`
- **Functionality**:
  - Creates project directories (e.g., `projects/axl/data`, `projects/axl/logs`).
  - Copies template files (e.g., `env_proj.sh`).
  - Generates `config.json` with project settings (e.g., project name, EDA tool).
  - Manages `employees.csv` for user roles and teams, with basic password hashing.
- **Interface**: PyQt5-based GUI for user input (project name, EDA tool, admin email).
- **Execution**: Run via `main.py` (e.g., `python main.py`).

### Goals for Next Version
- **Scalability**: Support large teams and multiple concurrent projects.
- **Security**: Meet enterprise-grade security and compliance standards (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2).
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with industry-standard tools (e.g., Git, Jira, EDA tools).
- **Usability**: Enhance flexibility and user experience with advanced settings and visualizations.
- **Automation**: Automate setup tasks and support extensibility via plugins.
- **Collaboration**: Enable collaborative project setup for distributed teams.

---

## üõ† **Focus Areas for Future Enhancements**

### 1. Scalability and Data Management
**Objective**: Enable `setup_gui` to handle large-scale, concurrent project setups for enterprise teams.

#### Planned Features
- **Database Integration**:
  - Replace file-based storage (`config.json`, `employees.csv`) with a centralized database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
  - **Schema**:
    - `projects`: Stores project metadata (e.g., `name`, `eda_tool`, `admin_email`, `created_at`, `created_by`).
    - `users`: Stores user details (e.g., `name`, `email`, `team`, `team_lead`, `roles`, `password_hash`).
    - `audit_logs`: Stores setup actions for traceability.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Supports concurrent setups by multiple users (e.g., using database transactions).
    - Enables efficient querying and reporting (e.g., ‚ÄúList all projects created this month‚Äù).
    - Provides high availability and backup (e.g., database replication).

#### Implementation Strategy
- Choose PostgreSQL for its robustness and support for concurrent transactions.
- Use an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy in Python) to interact with the database.
- Migrate existing JSON/CSV data to the database during the upgrade process.
- Implement database connection pooling to handle high concurrency.

#### Future Considerations
- Support sharding or partitioning for extremely large deployments (e.g., thousands of projects).
- Integrate with cloud-native databases (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud Spanner) for global scalability.

---

### 2. Security and Compliance
**Objective**: Ensure `setup_gui` meets enterprise-grade security standards and complies with industry regulations.

#### Planned Features
- **Authentication**:
  - Add support for Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML/OAuth (e.g., integrate with Okta, Azure AD).
  - Replace `hashlib.sha256` with `bcrypt` or `argon2` for password hashing.
- **Authorization**:
  - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict project setup to admin users.
  - Example: Only users with the `admin` role can create projects.
- **Data Protection**:
  - Encrypt sensitive files (e.g., `env_proj.sh`, user data) using AES-256 encryption.
  - Use HTTPS for all network communication (e.g., if `setup_gui` interacts with external APIs).
- **Audit Logging**:
  - Log all setup actions to the `audit_logs` table in the database.
  - Example: ‚ÄúProject axl created by user sumalatha at 2025-05-10T10:00:00Z‚Äù.
  - Ensure logs are tamper-proof (e.g., use hash chaining).

#### Implementation Strategy
- Use the `python-saml` library for SSO integration.
- Use the `cryptography` library for file encryption:
  ```python
  from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

  key = Fernet.generate_key()
  cipher = Fernet(key)
  with open("env_proj.sh", "rb") as f:
      encrypted = cipher.encrypt(f.read())
  ```
- Implement RBAC by checking user roles in the database before allowing setup actions.
- Use a logging framework (e.g., Python‚Äôs `logging` module) to write to the `audit_logs` table.

#### Future Considerations
- Achieve compliance with ISO 27001 and SOC 2 through third-party audits.
- Implement zero-trust architecture (e.g., authenticate and authorize all API calls).
- Add multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

---

### 3. Integration with Industry-Standard Tools
**Objective**: Seamlessly integrate `setup_gui` with the broader ASIC design ecosystem.

#### Planned Features
- **Version Control (Git)**:
  - Automatically initialize a Git repository for the project.
  - Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive files (e.g., `*.log`, `*.gds`).
  - Example: Commit initial project files with a message like ‚ÄúInitial project setup‚Äù.
- **Project Management (Jira)**:
  - Create a Jira project for the new ASIC project using the Jira API.
  - Example: Create a Jira project named ‚ÄúAXL‚Äù with tickets for RTL, PnR, and STA phases.
- **EDA Tool Configuration**:
  - Validate and configure EDA tool licenses during setup.
  - Example: Check Synopsys license availability and configure the license server in `env_proj.sh`.
- **Cloud Integration**:
  - Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision cloud resources (e.g., AWS Batch for EDA tool execution).
  - Example: Use Terraform to set up an AWS Batch environment for the project.

#### Implementation Strategy
- Use the `gitpython` library to initialize Git repositories:
  ```python
  import git

  def init_git_repo(project_path):
      repo = git.Repo.init(project_path)
      with open(f"{project_path}/.gitignore", "w") as f:
          f.write("*.log\n*.gds\n")
      repo.index.add([".gitignore"])
      repo.index.commit("Initial commit")
  ```
- Use the `jira-python` library to integrate with Jira:
  ```python
  from jira import JIRA

  def create_jira_project(project_name):
      jira = JIRA(server="https://your-jira-instance", basic_auth=("user", "pass"))
      jira.create_project(project_name, "ASIC Project")
  ```
- Implement license validation by querying EDA tool license servers (e.g., via Synopsys License API).
- Use the `python-terraform` library to integrate with Terraform for cloud provisioning:
  ```python
  import terraform

  def provision_cloud_resources(project_name):
      tf = terraform.Terraform()
      tf.init()
      tf.apply(var={"project_name": project_name})
  ```

#### Future Considerations
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) to automate testing of project assets.
- Support additional project management tools (e.g., Asana, Trello).
- Integrate with EDA tool ecosystems for advanced configuration (e.g., Synopsys Design Compiler API for project-specific settings).

---

### 4. Usability and Flexibility
**Objective**: Enhance the user experience and support diverse project types.

#### Planned Features
- **Advanced Project Settings**:
  - Add fields for custom teams, resource constraints, and notification settings.
  - Example: Allow users to define teams (e.g., ‚ÄúDFT Team‚Äù) and set CPU/memory limits for cloud execution.
- **Template Management**:
  - Support multiple templates for different project types (e.g., ‚ÄúHigh-Performance ASIC‚Äù, ‚ÄúLow-Power ASIC‚Äù).
  - Allow users to upload custom templates.
- **Interactive Interface**:
  - Add a preview of the project structure (e.g., directory tree) before setup.
  - Provide tooltips and documentation for each field (e.g., ‚ÄúEDA Tool: Select the tool suite for this project‚Äù).
- **Multi-User Setup**:
  - Enable collaborative setup via a web-based interface (e.g., multiple admins can contribute to project configuration).

#### Implementation Strategy
- Enhance the PyQt5 GUI with additional fields and interactivity:
  ```python
  from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QTreeWidget, QTreeWidgetItem

  def add_project_preview(self, layout):
      self.preview_tree = QTreeWidget()
      self.preview_tree.setHeaderLabels(["Project Structure"])
      layout.addRow("Preview:", self.preview_tree)

  def update_preview(self, project_name):
      self.preview_tree.clear()
      root = QTreeWidgetItem([project_name])
      for subdir in ["data", "logs", "reports", "outputs", "user_scripts"]:
          QTreeWidgetItem(root, [subdir])
      self.preview_tree.addTopLevelItem(root)
      self.preview_tree.expandAll()
  ```
- Store templates in a `templates/` directory with metadata (e.g., `template.json` for each template).
- For collaborative setup, develop a web-based interface using Django and WebSocket:
  - Use Django for the backend API.
  - Use React for the frontend with real-time updates via WebSocket.

#### Future Considerations
- Add support for project templates with AI-generated assets (e.g., auto-generate SDC files based on project type).
- Implement a wizard mode in the GUI to guide users through the setup process step-by-step.
- Support internationalization (i18n) for global teams (e.g., translations for GUI labels).

---

### 5. Automation and Extensibility
**Objective**: Automate setup tasks and support extensibility for custom workflows.

#### Planned Features
- **Automated Asset Generation**:
  - Auto-generate TCL scripts, SDC files, and testbenches based on project type.
  - Example: For a ‚ÄúLow-Power ASIC‚Äù template, generate power-aware synthesis scripts.
- **Plugin Support**:
  - Allow custom plugins for EDA tool setup and other tasks.
  - Example: A plugin for Synopsys tools to configure specific settings (e.g., license server, tool versions).
- **Environment Setup**:
  - Automate environment setup for EDA tools (e.g., configure `env_proj.sh` with tool paths).
  - Use IaC to provision cloud resources (already covered in Integration section).

#### Implementation Strategy
- Implement a script generator for TCL scripts:
  ```python
  def generate_tcl_scripts(project_path, template):
      if template == "Low-Power ASIC":
          with open(f"{project_path}/user_scripts/run_synthesis.tcl", "w") as f:
              f.write("set POWER_OPTIMIZATION true\n# Add synthesis commands\n")
  ```
- Create a plugin system using Python‚Äôs dynamic module loading:
  ```python
  import importlib

  def load_plugins():
      plugins = []
      for plugin_name in ["synopsys_setup", "cadence_setup"]:
          plugin = importlib.import_module(f"setup_gui.plugins.{plugin_name}")
          plugins.append(plugin)
      return plugins
  ```
- Update `env_proj.sh` dynamically based on the selected EDA tool:
  ```python
  def configure_env_script(project_path, eda_tool):
      with open(f"{project_path}/env_proj.sh", "a") as f:
          if eda_tool == "Synopsys":
              f.write("export SYNOPSYS_HOME=/path/to/synopsys\n")
  ```

#### Future Considerations
- Use AI to auto-generate more complex assets (e.g., testbenches, timing constraints).
- Support plugin marketplaces for community-contributed plugins.
- Integrate with containerization (e.g., Docker) for portable EDA tool environments.

---

### 6. Collaboration and Real-Time Features

  - Example: Users can access `setup_gui` via a browser (e.g., `https://logiclance/setup`).
- **Real-Time Collaboration**:
  - Allow multiple users to contribute to project setup simultaneously.
  - Example: One admin defines teams, another configures notifications, with changes reflected in real time.
- **Notifications**:
  - Notify team leads when a new project is created.
  - Example: Send a Slack message: ‚ÄúNew project axl created by sumalatha.‚Äù

#### Implementation Strategy
- Develop a web-based interface using Django (backend) and React (frontend):
  - Django API endpoints for project setup (`POST /projects`, `GET /projects`).
  - React frontend with forms for project settings.
  - Use WebSocket (e.g., Django Channels) for real-time updates:
    ```python
    # Django Channels consumer
    class SetupConsumer(WebsocketConsumer):
        def connect(self):
            self.accept()
            async_to_sync(self.channel_layer.group_add)("setup_group", self.channel_name)

        def receive(self, text_data):
            data = json.loads(text_data)
            if data["action"] == "update_project":
                async_to_sync(self.channel_layer.group_send)(
                    "setup_group",
                    {"type": "project_update", "message": data["project"]}
                )
    ```
- Integrate with Slack for notifications using the `slack_sdk` library:
  ```python
  from slack_sdk import WebClient

  def notify_slack(project_name, user):
      client = WebClient(token="your-slack-token")
      client.chat_postMessage(
          channel="#project-notifications",
          text=f"New project {project_name} created by {user}."
      )
  ```

#### Future Considerations
- Add video/audio chat integration for setup meetings (e.g., via WebRTC).
- Support offline mode with sync capabilities for users with limited connectivity.
- Integrate with Microsoft Teams or other collaboration platforms.

---

### 7. Auditability and Traceability
**Objective**: Ensure all setup actions are logged and traceable for compliance and debugging.

#### Planned Features
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**:
  - Log all setup actions (e.g., project creation, user addition) to the `audit_logs` table.
  - Example: ‚ÄúProject axl created by sumalatha at 2025-05-10T10:00:00Z‚Äù.
- **Version History**:
  - Track changes to project configurations over time.
  - Example: Store a history of `config.json` changes in the database.
- **Exportable Logs**:
  - Allow admins to export audit logs for compliance audits.

#### Implementation Strategy
- Implement audit logging in the database:
  ```python
  def log_action(user, action, details):
      with sqlite3.connect("logiclance.db") as conn:
          conn.execute(
              "INSERT INTO audit_logs (timestamp, user, action, details) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
              (datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z", user, action, details)
          )
  ```
- Store version history using a `project_versions` table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE project_versions (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      project_id INTEGER,
      version INTEGER,
      config_json TEXT,
      updated_at TEXT,
      updated_by TEXT
  );
  ```
- Add an export feature in the web interface:
  ```python
  def export_audit_logs():
      with sqlite3.connect("logiclance.db") as conn:
          logs = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM audit_logs").fetchall()
      with open("audit_logs.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
          writer = csv.writer(f)
          writer.writerow(["timestamp", "user", "action", "details"])
          writer.writerows(logs)
  ```

#### Future Considerations
- Implement digital signatures for audit logs to ensure integrity.
